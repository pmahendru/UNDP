<section> <h5> 2. An evening/ nighly delivery round.</h5>
	<p> A low cost evening delivery round by cycle. What if in addition to the water received in the morning, SH provides a street hawker who makes nightly rounds to give extra water to families in need.

			<h5> 3. Testing annual subscription + product bundling</h5>
			<p>While in Odisha, I saw that even though children drink clean water at home, they do not have access to this water in school, and not everyone carries SH water with them when they leave home. To address this, what if SH were to provide clean water at multiple community hot spots, like schools, bus stops or Kirana shops. You can access this water is you have subscribed to and received Special spring health drinking vessels.

<section> <h5>4. People take pride in drinking clean water </h5>
	<p>People look to their neighbors for inspiration, tips and tricks around everything. In Odisha, I noticed that families paint the walls outside their home with celebrations of marriage and welcome signs. What if I were to recognize these outspoken families and paint a Spring Health pattern or a mural on their wall to signify their loyalty towards clean water, so that they can take pride in their actions and motivate others to do the same.

		<section> <h5> 5. Finding the positive deviants</h5>
			<p>There are Self Help Groups of women in every village. These women are highly respected within their community and are also part of a larger network that connects these women to others like them from different villages. They are independent, entrepreneurial and community driven. What if we were to use their network and influence so that they became Spring Health saleswomen and advocates of clean water.
